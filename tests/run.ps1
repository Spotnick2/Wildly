    run.ps1 - Run all Wildly unit tests.

    The tests are plain Lua 5.1 scripts (no dependencies) that load the addon
    files against tests/wow_stubs.lua. WoW uses Lua 5.1, so the tests do too -
    not the newer Lua that may be first on PATH.

    Wildly embeds two libraries, loaded before its own files: LibGlass-1.0
    (the glass material) and LibGroupBuffs-1.0 (the compat layer, engine and
    window, which draws with LibGlass). The tests read each from a checkout
    next to this repository - ../LibGlass and ../LibGroupBuffs - or from
    -LibGlass / $env:LIBGLASS and -Library. There is no vendored copy to fall
    back to: a stale one would let the suite pass against code that no longer
    ships.

    Usage:
        pwsh tests/run.ps1
        pwsh tests/run.ps1 -Lua "C:\path\to\lua5.1.exe"
        pwsh tests/run.ps1 -Luac "C:\path\to\luac5.1.exe"
        pwsh tests/run.ps1 -Library "D:\src\LibGroupBuffs" -LibGlass "D:\src\LibGlass"
